Write MySQL 5.7 code to update status column in `bill` table with information from `receipt` table.

If the bill is fully paid, then the status should be updated to 'PAID'.
If the bill is partially paid, then the status should be updated to 'PARTIAL'.
If the bill is not paid at all, then the status should be updated to 'UNPAID'.
